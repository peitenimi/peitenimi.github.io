                  Oh, let us have some pie."</p>

                  <p>The three little kittens put on their mittens,
                    And soon ate up the pie,

                    <p>The three little kittens, they washed their mittens,
                      And hung them out to dry,
                      "Oh, mother dear, do you not hear,
                      That we have washed our mittens?"
                      "What, washed your mittens, then you're good kittens,
                      But I smell a rat close by."
                      "Meow, meow, meow,
                      We smell a rat close by."</p>

              <p>Mine, says the cat, putting out his paw of darkness.
                My lover, my friend, my slave, my toy, says
                the cat making on your chest his gesture of drawing
                milk from his mother’s forgotten breasts.</p>
                <p>Let us walk in the woods, says the cat.
                  I’ll teach you to read the tabloid of scents,
                  to fade into shadow, wait like a trap, to hunt.
                  Now I lay this plump warm mouse on your mat.</p>
                <p>You feed me, I try to feed you, we are friends,
                  says the cat, although I am more equal than you.
                  Can you leap twenty times the height of your body?
                  Can you run up and down trees? Jump between roofs?</p>
                <p>Let us rub our bodies together and talk of touch.
                  My emotions are pure as salt crystals and as hard.
                  My lusts glow like my eyes. I sing to you in the mornings
                  walking round and round your bed and into your face.</p>
                <p>Come I will teach you to dance as naturally
                  as falling asleep and waking and stretching long, long.
                  I speak greed with my paws and fear with my whiskers.
                  Envy lashes my tail. Love speaks me entire, a word</p>
                <p>of fur. I will teach you to be still as an egg
                  and to slip like the ghost of wind through the grass.</p>
